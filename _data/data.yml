experiences:
    - role: Lead Developer
      time: 5/2017 – 7/2017
      company: # Startup Hubs, San Francisco
      details: |
        Led a 5-person team to develop a parking car sharing mobile application (PnPark) which can be downloaded from several major app markets, including markets on both Android and IOS platform.
    - role: Co-developer
      time: 8/2017 – 10/2017
      company: # Google, London
      details: |
        Collaborated with a team of 6 peers to design and build a software analyzing and bug detecting system which has a high level of stability and efficiency. In charge of designing the analyzing and detecting engine part.
     - role: Lead Developer
       time: 9/2018 – 9/2019
       company: # Google, London
       details: |
        Led a team of 6 peers to develop a vulnerability detecting system which can tackle high-level control-flow related (CFR) vulnerabilities, such as insufficient control flow management (CWE-691), business logic errors (CWE-840), and program behavioral problems (CWE-438). Wrote the paper: (ICECCS’19, CORE-A) Static Detection of Control-Flow-Related Vulnerabilities Using Graph Embedding.

      time: 12/2019 – 5/2020
      company: # Amazon, London
      details: |
        Collaborated with a team of 4 peers to present a new code embedding approach that precisely preserves interprocedural program dependence, which successfully boosts the performance of two recent code embedding approaches code2vec and code2seq for two client applications, i.e., code classification and code summarization. Wrote the paper: (OOPSLA’20, CORE-A*, to appear) Flow2Vec: Value-Flow-Based Precise Code Embedding.
    - role: Lead Developer
      time: 9/2019 - 9/2020
      company: # Amazon, London
      details: |
        Led a 6-person team to develop a new deep-learning-based embedding approach to static detection of software vulnerabilities for C/C++ programs by leveraging advanced recent neural networks to embed code fragments in a compact representation that preserves high-level programming logic. Wrote the paper: (TOSEM’20, CCF-A, to appear) Statically Detecting Software Vulnerabilities using Deep Graph Neural Networks.
